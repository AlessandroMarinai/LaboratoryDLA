# LAB3
In this laboratory I've made many exercises with the Gymnasium Environment using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
To run this notebook you will need to either run it on Colab and execute the setup cells or create an environment with the following non-standard packages:
* gymnasium ( a great advice for windows users is to firstly install swig and then install gymnasium[all]
* wandb 
* torch
